# Peer Angular Challenge

ALL RIGHT! Set up a *NEW* project! From the ground up.
Bring in Angular, that's all we will need for our project today.

## Business Need:
We have been hired by the federal government to help them speed up the process electing a president. Counting votes takes a long time, so they'd like us to create an application to select a canidate at random. It's easier that way.


## Technical Requirements
Our application will request 2 payloads from two different Express end points (one for Republicans and one for Democrats). Feel free to use real or made up politcians (like there's a difference anymore, amiright?).

Two buttons should be put on the view. One to load the canidates, another to kick off the winner selection. You may display which canidate has been chosen in any way you choose (be creative!).

## Hard Mode:
Style your application with CSS, make it look presentable (think 'Merica).

## Pro Mode:
Add a third end point to load the winner from (selection not done on the client side).
